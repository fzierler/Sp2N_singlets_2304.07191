## SESAM/TχL

The mass of the eta' meson was obtained from figure 7 (lower panel) of Ref. [1]. For every ensemble we have chosen the mass associated with the larger uncertainties. The mass ratios $m_\pi / m_\rho$ were taken from table 1 in Ref. [1]. The masses of the pions were taken from Ref. [2].

## UKQCD1

The masses $m_{\eta'}$ and $m_{\pi}$ have been given in table I of Ref. [3]. The corresponding mass ratio $m_\pi / m_\rho$ was taken from table V in Ref. [4]

## UKQCD2

The masses of the $\pi$ and the $\rho$ meson have been taken form table I in Ref. [5]. The $\eta'$ mass of the heavier ensemble has been taken from table III. For the lighter ensemble the authors noted that they were "unable to obtain convincing and consistent fits". By comparing the ratio of the $\eta'$ correlators at different hopping parameters they obtain the estimate of $m_{\eta'}=0.40(5)$ -- see section IV and figure 7 of Ref. [5]. 

## CLQCD

Data taken from tables II and VIII of Ref. [6].

## CP-PACS

Data from Ref. [7] -- $m_\pi/m_\rho$ from table I, $m_{\eta'}$ and $m_\pi$ from table II. Two fitting strategies were used in Ref. [7]. We combine both methods and quote the largest and smallest values of $m \pm \Delta m$.

## RBC/DWF

Data from Ref. [8], tables III, V and VIII. The mases were obtained with a single exponential fit, denoted as method (A) in Ref. [8].

## Beijing

Data from Ref. [9], tables II ($m_\rho$), section II.A below equation (4) ($m_\rho$), equation (9) ($m_{\rho}$).

## ETMC1

The $\eta'$ masses were taken from table 4 of Ref. [10]. The masses of the pions and vector mesons were taken from table 3 of Ref. [11]. The twisted mass action introduces explicit strong isospin breaking. We estimate the flavour-symmetric mass for the pion $\pi$ as $m_\pi \approx ( m_{\pi^\pm} + \Delta m_{\pi^\pm} + m_{\pi^0} - \Delta m_{\pi^0})/2$ and its uncertainty by $\Delta m_\pi \approx ( m_{\pi^\pm} + \Delta m_{\pi^\pm} - m_{\pi^0} + \Delta m_{\pi^0})/2$. We estimate the flavour symmetric vector meson mass in the same way.  


## ETMC2

The vector meson masses are taken from table III in Ref. [12]. We chose the results obtained from the inverse amplitude method (IAM) and symmetrize the uncertainties. The pion and $\eta'$ masses are taken from table II in Ref. [13]. For the $\eta'$ we use the mass obtained using fermionic interpolators. We estimate the flavour-symmetric mass for the pion $\pi$ as $m_\pi \approx ( m_{\pi^\pm} + \Delta m_{\pi^\pm} + m_{\pi^0} - \Delta m_{\pi^0})/2$ and its uncertainty by $\Delta m_\pi \approx ( m_{\pi^\pm} + \Delta m_{\pi^\pm} - m_{\pi^0} + \Delta m_{\pi^0})/2$. We convert these results into "physical" units using $a = 0.0931(2)~\rm{fm}$.
